
Interview Tip

In a typical interview you’ll be asked “why are you interested in this role?” or “why are you interested in working at our company?”. Use this interview tip to explain why you want the job.

“Why are you interested in this role?”
I recently participated in Accenture’s Data Analytics & Visualization job simulation on the Forage platform, and it was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to participate in a typical project team at Accenture, and to use Excel and data analytics and visualization skills in a realistic context. 
Through this program I realized that I really enjoy cleaning, modelling and analyzing client data, creating slides to communicate findings and presenting insights back to the client. I would love to apply what I've learned in a diverse project team at a company like Accenture.
